## Shower Door Edge Adjuster

This shower door adjuster solves a problem for when a tub enclosure was installed with out
verifying that the walls were perfectly vertical and the floor was perfectly horizontal.

As nothing is perfect, the side of the shower where the door meets it has a  door has metal rail with
a plastic insert that grabs the edge of the door, so that when the door is closed, it takes
an intentional pull to open the door.

The problem in my case is that the floor and tub are very slight slant downwards from that
edge so the door tends to open a few inches on its own.

As the wall is not perfectly vertical the top of the door does not reach the rail to for
the edge to grab it.

Of course all this was not noticed until after everything was pretty much permanently mounted.

So this adapter, printed in translucent PETG clips on to the top of the shower door and then
also extends to meet the side rail, which holds the door into position.

Unless you know to look for it, this adapter is not visible and if you do see it, it looks
like it is suppose to be there.
